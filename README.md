# POC Project: Instruction sets simulation and assembly
Someday, there will be some clever words. :leaves:

---

## Description:

### Project goals: :cherry_blossom:

* Create simple command sets, which will belong to different architectures
(which are listed below)

* Create a simulator (to see differences in these architectures)

* Create a (simple) assembly language for others to use

*Architectures:*

* First category

  1. Stack architecture

  2. Accumulator (?) architecture

  3. Register architecture

* Second category

  1. RISC

  2. CISC

* Third category

  1. Von Neumann architecture

  2. Harvard architecture

  3. Modified Harvard architecture

* Forth category

  1. Memory mapped input-output (I/O)

  2. Separate space (I/O)

  3. Separate commands (I/O)

_(There also exists some SIMD, but it is scary, so we will not talk about that)_


### What we will (possibly) use: :maple_leaf:
