# POC Project: Instruction sets simulation and assembly
Someday, there will be some clever words. :leaves:

---

## Description:

### Project goals: :cherry_blossom:

* Create simple instruction sets, which will belong to different architectures
(which are listed below)

* Create a simulator (to see differences in these architectures)

* Create a (simple) assembly language for others to use

*Architectures:*

* Instruction Set Architecture (Register Architecture)

  1. Stack (Zero-Address)

  2. Accumulator (One-Address)

  3. Register (Two-Address)

* Instruction Set Complexity

  1. Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)
  
  2. Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC)

* General Architecture

  1. Von Neumann (Princeton) architecture

  2. Harvard architecture
  
  3. Modified Harvard architecture

* Input/Output

  1. Memory-Mapped I/O
  
  2. Separate Space MMIO
  
  3. Special commands

_(There also exists some SIMD, but it is scary, ~~so we will not talk about that~~ we will talk about that a bit later)_


### What we will (possibly) use: :maple_leaf:

* Python

* Qt for GUI

### Examples and resources: :fallen_leaf:

* Guidelines from [nand2tetris](http://f.javier.io/rep/books/The%20Elements%20of%20Computing%20Systems.pdf)
