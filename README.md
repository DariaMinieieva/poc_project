# Hardware Simulator and Assembler
[Website](http://assemblysimulator.pythonanywhere.com)
---

## Description:

A Hardware Simulator and an Assembler with its own assembly language, 
with several Instruction Set, Memory, I/O Architectures supported.

## Architectures:

* Instruction Set Architecture (Register Architecture)

  1. Stack (Zero-Address)

  2. Accumulator (One-Address)

  3. Register (Two-Address)

* Instruction Set Complexity

  1. Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)
  
  2. Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC)

* General Memory Architecture

  1. Von Neumann (Princeton) architecture

  2. Harvard architecture
  
  3. Modified Harvard architecture

* Input/Output

  1. Memory-Mapped I/O
  
  2. Separate Space MMIO
  
  3. Special commands

+ SIMD

## General project layout

~~You should not, under any circumstances try to understand what's going on there~~
* `./docs` contains the specs and docs we started this project with,
and a 'help' document representing the current state of things with,
supposedly, human-readable documentation
* `./modules` contains the general 'backend' modules of the project, 
an assembler and a hardware simulator
* `./website` contains the general 'frontend' modules of the project, 
the things running the simulator web page and help pages

## Prerequisites:

Admittedly, there are a lot of those, but we plan _(do we really?)_ to rewrite the front-end without using Dash.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---

## Testing:

```bash
python3 modules/test_assembler.py
python3 modules/test_processor.py
# After every run, there is a detailed log saved in ./log.txt
less log.txt
```
